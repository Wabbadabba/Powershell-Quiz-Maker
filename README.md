# Quizzer!
Menu controlled quiz generator that randomizes questions, answer choices, and can give basic statistics on pass/fail status

**Update 4/72018**:
Basic UI has been added! Huge shoutout to Roman Gelman at https://ps1code.com/ for the menu function that allowed this to happen. Quizzer now can alter the parameters of the quiz through a menu system.

Quick note: All csv question banks must be in the .\quizzes folder relative to the Quizzer.ps1 script.

All new CSVs must be formatted with the headers: QuestionText,Answer1,Answer2,Answer3,Answer4,CorrectAnswer.



**Update 2/22/2018**:
Statistics have been added at completion. It will not give feedback on correct/incorrect answer after input, and will give percentage of correct.
